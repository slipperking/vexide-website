The **Inertial Sensor**, also known as the **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** is a sensor that measures a robot's orientation and acceleration on 3 axes. It contains a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer.

These sensors are useful for autonomous robot control. They give you an accurate reading of your robot's heading and can be used for executing precise turns when paired with a control loop such as a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). They can also detect if a robot has tipped or collided with something.

# Creating Inertial Sensors

Using the `Peripherals` struct passed to our `main` function, we can create our sensor from any one of the 21 `SmartPort` fields on it.

```rs
// @fold start
use vexide::prelude::*;

// @fold end
#[vexide::main]
async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
    //                                (                )
    let mut imu = InertialSensor::new(peripherals.port_1);
    //                               ^
    //                  [Create a sensor on port 1.]
}
```

For this example, we'll assume that the sensor is plugged into port 1 on the brain, but you can create a sensor from any unused port. For example, to create one on port 2 you would replace `peripherals.port_1` with `peripherals.port_2`.

<!-- # Calibration

Before we can actually use the sensor, we need to *calibrate* it. -->
