Symbolizer for VEX V5 is out! It's a new extension for Visual Studio Code which makes it easier to debug crashes on VEX V5 robots by finding the lines of code on which the crash happened. It's really useful for stepping through vexide (or PROS) backtraces or quickly revealing the location of an abort!
